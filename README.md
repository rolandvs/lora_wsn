_Combination of LoRa and a Wireless Sensor Network_

## Nothing
Internet of Things is about have everything connected to each other. It seems that with the advent of IoT everything should be connected directly to the Internet. The shortest way from sensor to database seems to be the hype of today. If we get all we can measure into the cloud then the number crunchers (i.e. big data analytics) will predict the future. This can be seen as a _many to one_ system and _big data_ is just another name for _big brother_.

Before IoT we had M2M (Machine to Machine). M2M was centered around the use of GSM/GPRS/UMTS/LTE technology for communication in much the same way as IoT today.

The business model for M2M is a recurring fee for use of the network. The costs are based on a fixed monthly fee and variable fee depending on the number of bits transferred. For UNB (Ultra Narrow Band) the business model is fixed cost per device per month, but with limits on the maximum throughput.

In Iot the UNB networks (i.e. Weightless, LoRa, sigfox, and others) have gained a lot of traction. They are _the solution_ in situations where the cost compared to M2M are significantly lower, however limited in data throughput.
