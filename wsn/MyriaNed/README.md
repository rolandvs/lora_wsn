# Wireless Sensor Networks

Wireless Sensor Networks (`WSN`) can be defined as short to medium range wireless networks with different topologies like star and mesh. The most popular networks are `Bluetooth`, `EnOcean`, `IPv6LoPAN`, `MyriaNed`, `Thread`, `Zigbee`, `ZWave`, `Wi-Fi`, `WirelessHART` and many (proprietary) others.

There are many more wireless standards, however do not represent a network technology like `UWB`. On the other hand UWB is extremely useful in localization of objects with centimeter accuracy.

We do not want to repeat information that is already widely available, but where needed additional information will be provided.
